## Overview
This project is the result of what I did during my internship at the Electronics and Digital Systems Laboratory at Sriwijaya University. In this project I apply Tsukamoto's Fuzzy theory in predicting the amount of stock that must be provided in the Supply Chain Management system. To identify products here, I use a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system. And use PHP Cron Job to run fuzzy logic every day ends.
